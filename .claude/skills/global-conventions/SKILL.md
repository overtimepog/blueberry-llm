name: Global Conventions
description: Follow project-wide development conventions including project structure, documentation standards, version control practices, environment configuration, and dependency management. Use this skill when organizing files and directories, writing README documentation, creating commit messages, managing environment variables, updating dependencies, or establishing code review processes. Apply this skill when ensuring consistent project structure (src/, components/, utils/, tests/), maintaining up-to-date documentation, using clear commit messages and feature branches, properly configuring environment variables without committing secrets, keeping dependencies minimal and documented, and implementing feature flags for incomplete work. This skill ensures the entire team follows predictable patterns for project organization, maintains comprehensive documentation for setup and architecture, practices good version control hygiene, manages configuration securely, and establishes clear workflows for testing and code review.

# Global Conventions

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global conventions.

## When to use this skill

- When organizing or restructuring project directories and file hierarchies
- When creating or updating README files, setup instructions, or architecture documentation
- When writing commit messages or creating feature branches
- When setting up environment configuration files (.env, config files)
- When managing secrets, API keys, or sensitive configuration (never commit to version control)
- When adding, removing, or updating project dependencies
- When documenting why major dependencies or architectural decisions were made
- When establishing or following code review processes and PR/MR conventions
- When implementing feature flags for incomplete features instead of long-lived branches
- When maintaining changelogs or release notes
- When ensuring project structure is logical and navigable (src/, tests/, docs/, config/)
- When defining testing requirements before merging (unit tests, integration tests, coverage)
- When setting up CI/CD pipelines or deployment workflows
- When onboarding new team members with clear contribution guidelines
