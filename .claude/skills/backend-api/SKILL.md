name: Backend API
description: Design and implement RESTful APIs, GraphQL endpoints, and backend API architecture following modern standards. Use this skill when creating or modifying API endpoints, route handlers, controllers, API middleware, authentication/authorization logic, or any files that define HTTP endpoints such as routes.py, api.js, controllers/, endpoints/, or API specification files (OpenAPI/Swagger). Apply this skill when implementing API versioning, rate limiting, request/response handling, API documentation, or when working with API gateway configurations. This skill is essential for building scalable, secure, and well-documented APIs that follow RESTful principles, handle errors gracefully, and provide consistent developer experiences across microservices and serverless architectures.

# Backend API

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend API.

## When to use this skill

- When creating or modifying REST API endpoints, routes, or controllers
- When implementing GraphQL schemas, resolvers, or queries
- When working on API middleware, authentication, or authorization logic
- When designing API request/response structures and data serialization
- When implementing API versioning strategies (URL path or header-based)
- When adding rate limiting, throttling, or API security features
- When writing API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger specifications)
- When working with files like `routes.py`, `api.js`, `controllers/`, `endpoints/`, or API gateway configs
- When implementing error handling and consistent HTTP status codes for APIs
- When building microservices communication patterns or serverless API functions
- When adding pagination, filtering, sorting, or search capabilities to API endpoints
- When implementing async APIs, webhooks, or event-driven API patterns
