name: Frontend Accessibility
description: Build accessible user interfaces following WCAG 2.2 standards with proper semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support. Use this skill when creating or modifying UI components, forms, interactive elements, navigation menus, modals, or any frontend code that users interact with. Apply this skill when implementing keyboard navigation, focus management, color contrast requirements, alternative text for images, form labels, ARIA roles and landmarks, or when ensuring components work with assistive technologies like screen readers. This skill is essential when working with React, Vue, or other framework components, HTML templates, JSX files, or any UI implementation to ensure inclusive design that serves users with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive disabilities and meets legal compliance standards (ADA, WCAG 2.2 Level AA).
