name: Global Tech Stack
description: Reference and maintain the project's technology stack including frameworks, languages, databases, testing tools, and third-party services to ensure consistency across the codebase. Use this skill when making technology decisions, adding new dependencies, choosing appropriate tools or libraries, configuring build systems, setting up testing frameworks, or documenting the tech stack. Apply this skill when selecting which framework, library, or tool to use for a given task, when ensuring code follows the conventions of the chosen stack (React patterns, Python idioms, Rails conventions), when integrating third-party services, or when documenting technology choices in README or architecture documentation. This skill ensures all team members use consistent technologies, new additions align with existing stack decisions, technology choices are documented with rationale, and the project maintains coherent patterns rather than mixing conflicting approaches or frameworks.

# Global Tech Stack

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global tech stack.

## When to use this skill

- When making decisions about which framework, library, or tool to use for a task
- When adding new dependencies or third-party packages to the project
- When choosing between alternative approaches that are framework or stack-specific
- When configuring build tools, bundlers, or compilation settings
- When setting up testing frameworks, linting tools, or formatting tools
- When integrating third-party services (authentication, email, monitoring, analytics)
- When documenting the tech stack in README, architecture docs, or team wikis
- When ensuring code follows the idioms and patterns of the chosen languages/frameworks
- When onboarding new developers to understand the project's technology decisions
- When updating major dependencies or migrating between framework versions
- When evaluating whether to adopt new technologies or stick with existing choices
- When ensuring consistency across frontend and backend technology choices
- When configuring CI/CD pipelines to match the project's stack requirements
- When referencing the tech stack file at agent-os/standards/global/tech-stack.md for stack details
